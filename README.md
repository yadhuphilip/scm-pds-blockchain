E-PDS is a basic example of a distributed supply-chain
application. It provides load transfer with location tracking, which allows
users to transfer loads, ownerships and track them as they move through a supply chain.

E-PDS is built on Hyperledger Sawtooth, an enterprise
blockchain platform.
The available HTTP endpoints are:
- Client: **http://localhost:8040
- Sawtooth REST API: **http://localhost:8008
